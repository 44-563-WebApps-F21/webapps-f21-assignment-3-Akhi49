            HULK
        </h1>
<p>
    For his size, the Hulk is incredibly fast and can run great distances at extreme speeds. 
    He generally travels by jumping as described above though. The hulk is also <b>highly resistant</b> to damage, being near impervious to most forms of damage.
     Very little has been known to faze the Hulk, except those of the same <b>power level</b>> as the Hulk such as The Thing, Thor, Abomination, and others.
