            <p>
                Hyderabad is the capital of Telangana in Southern India, located on the banks of the Musi River and on the Deccan Plateau. 
                Hyderabad and Secunderabad are <b>twin cities</b> near Hussain Sagar Lake (also known as Tank Bund in local parlance) but both 
                cities have grown so much that now they have become one big metropolis. The city and district of Hyderabad are coterminous. 
                Hyderabad district is entirely contained within the Ranga Reddy district of Telangana. Many of the suburbs of Hyderabad were 
                recently merged into the city, now called <b>Greater Hyderabad</b>.
